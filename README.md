# Weekly Programming Challenges - Crypto Course

This repository contains my solutions to the weekly programming challenges for the [Crypto Course](https://www.coursera.org/unicamp](https://www.coursera.org/programs/universidade-estadual-de-campinas-learning-program-ot7gr/learn/crypto)) offered by Unicamp on Coursera.

Each week, we dive into different aspects of cryptography, learning about concepts like stream ciphers, block ciphers (such as AES encryption, decryption), MACs, and key exchange. The programming challenges allow us to apply these concepts in a practical manner.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized with one directory for each week's challenges. Inside each directory, you'll find Python scripts that solve the challenge, along with a 'ASSIGNEMNT-SOLUTION' file that explains my approach.

Here are some of the key directories:

- `Week2/`: Contains scripts for implementing AES encryption and decryption in both CBC and CTR modes.
    - `decrypt_aes_cbc.py`: Decrypts a given ciphertext using AES in CBC mode.
    - `decrypt_aes_ctr.py`: Decrypts a given ciphertext using AES in CTR mode.
    - `encrypt_aes_cbc.py`: Encrypts a given plaintext using AES in CBC mode.
    - `encrypt_aes_ctr.py`: Encrypts a given plaintext using AES in CTR mode.
