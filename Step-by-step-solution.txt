Step 1: Building the XOR Matrix (spaces_matrix.py)

The first step is to build a matrix by XORing every ciphertext with every other ciphertext. This is done using the spaces_matrix.py script. The script first converts each ciphertext from hexadecimal to binary. Then, it XORs each binary ciphertext with every other binary ciphertext. The result is a matrix of XORed ciphertexts.

Itâ€™s important to note that when a space is XORed with a letter, the space switches the case of the letter. This is because in ASCII, the binary representation of a space is 00100000, and the binary representations of uppercase and lowercase letters only differ in the 6th bit (counting from the right). Therefore, XORing a space with a letter toggles this 6th bit, effectively switching the case of the letter.

Step 2: Identifying Spaces (Testing_spaces.py)

The second step is to identify the positions in the ciphertexts that likely contain spaces. This is done using the Testing_spaces.py script. The script counts the occurrences of each position in the first three ciphertexts across all ciphertexts. If a position appears in at least 7 ciphertexts, it likely contains a space. The result is a list of positions that likely contain spaces. This list is then organized in another file (spaces_per_ct.txt).

Step 3: Decrypting the Target Ciphertext (Dicovering_each_letter.py)

The final step is to decrypt the target ciphertext. This is done by XORing the target ciphertext with the other ciphertexts for each position. By doing this, you can find out what letter was at each position in the target ciphertext. This is because XORing a ciphertext that contains a space at a certain position with another ciphertext that contains a letter at the same position will result in the letter in the opposite case. Therefore, you can determine the original letter in the target ciphertext.

By following these steps, you can decrypt the target ciphertext and reveal the secret message within it. This exercise demonstrates why reusing a key can lead to vulnerabilities that can be exploited to decrypt the ciphertexts
